# Changes added for tutorial step3

Been looking for a better free python IDE (don't want to pay for one at the mo!, especially not a subscription).
Been using IDLE for years, but it is very limited.

Tried pycharm community edition, but disliked the color theme and are limited to 3 choices.  
Did like the PEP8 checking though, something I really need to improve on. 

Been using eclipse neon for Java courses, so I am giving the PyDev extension a try.
Found a theme that emulates IDLE (what I am used to).  
Trying to get my head around how to structure projects in logical hierarchy.
Trying to integrate PEP8 checking.
